# nbdev template


nbdev project template.

Clone of https://github.com/fastai/nbdev_template.


A few files have been modified from master as of 2020-04-22:

- settings.ini - lightly modified to remove references to fastai
- setup.py - remove license details & license checking
- Delete LICENSE.
- In .github/workflows/main.yaml:
	- Disable tests
	- Disable nb diffs 	
	
 ... as these will both fail for the first run and can be re-enabled later.
